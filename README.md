# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Branch of computer science that deals with the development, testing and maintenance of software applications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Birth of Software Engineering- Created to address the software crisis.

Rise of Object-Oriented Programming- Object Oriented Principles promote code reusability and design

Agile and DevOps Practices - methods and culture have transformed software by emphasizing collaboration and continuous development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is a linear approach in which each phase is completed before proceeding to the next. It is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements.

Agile is an interactive approach that allows continuous adaptation. Best for startups developing new software products.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer-Writes and maintains code, and implements features. 

Quality Assurance Engineer-They also test and resolve software defects ensuring reliability and performance.

Project Manager- Oversees the project and ensures successful delivery

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE's provide code editing, debugging and automation tools; Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA

Version Control Systems track changes in code, allow collaboration and rollback; Git, Github

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

- Keeping up with technological changes, mitigated by continuous learning and training
- Management of bugs; Implemented through testing and debugging procedures
- Project scope; defining clear  requirements and managing 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing- Tests individual components or functions
Integration testing -ensures different modules work together
System Testing- tests the complete software system
Acceptance testing - verifies that software meet the user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

It is the practice of designing and refining prompts to obtain the most effective and relevant responses from AI models. It is important for optimizing AI interactions, ensuring accurate and useful outputs

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague- "Tell me about History"

Improved- "Provide a brief overview of the major events in the world history from the 20th Century

It is better because the improved version is specific, clear and concise and leads to an informative response
